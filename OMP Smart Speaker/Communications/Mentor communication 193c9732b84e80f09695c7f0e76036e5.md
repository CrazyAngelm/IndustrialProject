# Mentor communication

A meeting with a team mentor is a structured session where team members discuss progress, challenges, and goals with their mentor. The mentor provides guidance, feedback, and strategic advice to help the team improve performance, overcome obstacles, and align with project objectives. These meetings often involve reviewing milestones, brainstorming solutions, and setting action plans for future development.
