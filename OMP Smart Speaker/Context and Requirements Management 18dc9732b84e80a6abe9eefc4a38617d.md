# Context and Requirements Management

# Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a **Smart Speaker** that operates primarily in a **closed (offline) environment** without continuous Internet access. This is a proof of concept (PoC) to validate the feasibility of providing voice assistant functionality — such as speech recognition (STT), speech synthesis (TTS), and basic command processing — **entirely within a user’s local network** or infrastructure.
