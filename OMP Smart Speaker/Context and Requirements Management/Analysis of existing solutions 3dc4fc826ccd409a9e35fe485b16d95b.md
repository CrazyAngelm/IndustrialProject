# Analysis of existing solutions

# Abstract

The "Smart Speaker" project aims to create an offline, customizable voice assistant for office tasks, using the **OrangePi 5** platform. Key requirements include offline operation, Russian language support, and integration with embedded systems.

This analysis compares **Rhasspy**, **OpenVoiceOS**, **Vosk**, and **Picovoice** based on criteria such as open-source availability, speech-to-text accuracy, intent recognition, wake word detection, and custom skill development. **Rhasspy** is identified as the most suitable framework due to its offline capabilities, Russian language support, and integration flexibility. While **OpenVoiceOS** and **Vosk** are alternatives, they require more technical effort or offer limited customization. **Picovoice** excels in wake word detection but lacks broader flexibility.

The analysis highlights **Rhasspy** as the best option for the project, aligning with functional and technical needs.

Existing hardware projects and configuration software were also reviewed to assess their compatibility with the chosen platform.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Privacy/Offline Capability** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Scalability** | Moderate (requires tuning) | High (enterprise-level) | High (enterprise-level) | Moderate (requires tuning) |
| **Customization** | High | High | Moderate | High |
| **Integration with Enterprise Systems** | Moderate | High | High | Moderate |
| **Commercial Support** | None (community-based) | None (community-based) | Yes (commercial support) | None (community-based) |
| **Cost** | Free | Free | Commercial licensing fees | Free |
| **Development Effort** | Moderate | High (requires expertise) | Low to Moderate | Moderate to High |
- **Rhasspy**, **OpenVoiceOS**, and **Vosk** are excellent for enterprises that prioritize offline operation, privacy, and customization. However, they generally lack commercial support, meaning we'll need to maintain and scale the system.
- **Picovoice** offers strong enterprise-level support with a commercial licensing model. It‚Äôs excellent for embedded, offline voice processing and comes with good documentation and integrations, making it a good fit for enterprise use, though at a cost.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, **Rhasspy** emerges as the most suitable framework for the "Smart Speaker" project. It offers comprehensive offline functionality, strong privacy controls, Russian language support, and high customizability. While **OpenVoiceOS** is a competitive option with advanced features, its more complex setup process may require additional resources. **Vosk** is ideal for speech recognition tasks but may require additional development for full system functionality, while **Picovoice** excels in offline capabilities but is more limited in terms of customization and is tied to commercial licensing.
