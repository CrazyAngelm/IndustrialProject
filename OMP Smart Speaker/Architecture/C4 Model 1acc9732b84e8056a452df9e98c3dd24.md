# C4 Model

The **C4 model** (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) is a hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture. It provides a structured way to describe software systems at different levels of abstraction:

1. **Context (Level 1)** – Shows the system's high-level interactions with users and external systems.
2. **Containers (Level 2)** – Defines the major deployable units (e.g., databases, applications, services).
3. **Components (Level 3)** – Breaks down containers into components (e.g., modules, microservices).
4. **Code (Level 4)** – Represents the detailed implementation of individual components (e.g., class diagrams).

# Level 1 (Context)

This diagram represents the **System Context Diagram** for **Smart Speaker** project, based on the **C4 model (Level 1 - Context)**. It provides a high-level overview of how the **Smart Speaker** system interacts with its environment, including users and external systems.

## **Actors (People interacting with the system)**:

- **Office User (Person)**: The primary end-user who interacts with the **Smart Speaker** via **voice commands**.
- **Developer (Person)**: Responsible for **updating and configuring** the system.

## **Software Systems**:

1. **Smart Speaker**:
    1. Runs on **Orange Pi 5** hardware.
    2. Works **fully offline**.
    3. Provides **task and schedule management tools** for customers.
2. **Company Network** (External System):
    1. **Has internet access**.
    2. **Stores and updates** relevant information over time.
    3. The **Smart Speaker** retrieves necessary information from it.

## **Decision-Making:**

According to the current stage of a project, we have identified the Smart Speaker as a system that includes a [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework as a non-external service. By agreement with the customer, the Smart Speaker must be completely autonomous and not require Internet access. If additional data is needed (e.g., the current weather forecast) or a software update, the customer will provide an internal server with Internet access.

# Level 2 (Container - not Docker)

This is a **Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)** for **Smart Speaker** system. It provides a more detailed view of the internal components and how they interact.

## **Break down the Diagram:**

1. **Actors (People interacting with the system)**:
    1. **Office User**: Gives voice commands.
    2. **Developer**: Configures the system via `JSON.config`.
2. **Software Containers (Core Components of the System)**:
    1. **Rhasspy API (Docker Container)**: Handles **wake word detection**, **speech-to-text (STT)**, **text-to-speech (TTS)**, and **intent recognition**.
    2. **MQTT Broker (Mosquitto Container)**: Acts as a **message broker** for inter-service communication.
    3. **Python Backend Service (Python Container)**: Processes recognized intents and executes actions.
    4. **Database (SQLite Container)**: Stores **intent data** and **logs** for system tracking.

## **Decision-Making:**

1. **Started with Key Functionalities**:
    - The **Smart Speaker** needs to process voice commands, so **Rhasspy API** is the core.
    - Recognized intents need execution → **Python Backend Service** handles that.
    - Logs and historical data must be stored → **Database (SQLite)** was added.
    - Services need to communicate efficiently → **MQTT Broker** (Mosquitto) is used.
2. **Followed a Modular & Scalable Approach**:
    - Used **Docker** for Rhasspy to keep it isolated and portable.
    - **SQLite** fits well since the system is **offline** and doesn’t need a full-fledged database.
    - **MQTT Broker** enables decoupled communication between components.
3. **Considered Developer Interaction**:
    - Developers need a way to configure the system → Added **JSON-based configuration**.

# Level 3 (Component)

This is a **Component Diagram (C4 Level 3)** for the **Python Backend Service** of **Smart Speaker** system. It breaks down the backend service into its internal components and how they interact.

## **Breakdown of the Diagram**

1. **External Communication**:
    1. **MQTT Client (paho-mqtt)** receives **JSON output** from Rhasspy via MQTT messages.
    2. **MQTT Broker (Mosquitto)** receives processed responses from the backend.
2. **Core Processing Components**:
    1. **Intent Router**: Extracts **intent, parameters, and site ID**, then routes them as:
        - **Postponed**: Handles scheduled actions (timers, calendar events).
        - **Non-Postponed**: Processes immediate requests (e.g., "What time is it?").
    2. **EventChecker**: Periodically checks if a postponed event is due.
3. **Response Handling**:
    1. **Response Generator Component**: Generates responses to recognized intents and sends them back via MQTT.

## **Decision-Making:**

1. **Started with Core Backend Functionality**:
    - Since **intent execution** is the primary role of the backend, we needed an **Intent Router** to classify intents.
    - **Instant actions** (like asking for time) and **delayed actions** (like setting timers) required separate components.
2. **Added Communication Handling**:
    - Since Rhasspy communicates using **MQTT**, we included **MQTT Client** and **MQTT Broker** for message flow.
3. **Incorporated Event Scheduling**:
    - To manage **delayed events**, we added **Postponed** and **EventChecker** components.
4. **Ensured Response Generation**:
    - The **Response Generator Component** ensures users get feedback after intent execution.

# Level 4 (Code)

This is a **Class Diagram (UML)** that models a **Postponed Event System** for handling delayed tasks (such as timers or scheduled events).

![image.png](C4%20Model%201acc9732b84e8056a452df9e98c3dd24/image.png)

- `PostponedEvent` manages **delayed actions**, such as timers or calendar-based tasks.
- The event’s state (`EventEnum`) determines whether it should be executed or removed.
- Methods like `call_response_generator()` suggest the event **triggers a response** once completed.
