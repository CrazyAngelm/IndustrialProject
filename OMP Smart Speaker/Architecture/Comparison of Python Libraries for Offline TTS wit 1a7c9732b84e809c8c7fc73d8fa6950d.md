# Comparison of Python Libraries for Offline TTS with Russian Language Support

In this review, we consider several open-source neural TTS engines and libraries for speech synthesis with support for the Russian language. All solutions work offline (without an internet connection) and are compatible with Linux (ARM platforms, including OrangePi 5 Pro running Ubuntu/Debian). The key evaluation criteria were: **speech quality and performance**, **ease of integration (installation and usage in Python)**, **availability of Russian voices**, and **compatibility with single-board computers**. Below is a comparative table followed by a detailed review of each solution, including their advantages, disadvantages, and installation instructions on Linux.

## Piper

**Piper** is a local neural TTS engine specifically optimized for low-power devices (developed with a focus on Raspberry Pi 4) [REDDIT.COM](https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/comments/1c5pxhv/best_offline_texttospeech_tts_for_raspberry_pi_in/#:~:text=Hey%20everyone%21%20I%27ve%20scoured%20the,that%20you%20can%20test%20here). Piper uses voice models trained with the VITS architecture, exported in ONNX format [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=Listen%20to%20voice%20samples%20and,video%20tutorial%20by%20Thorsten%20M%C3%BCller) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=Voices%20are%20trained%20with%20VITS,and%20exported%20to%20the%20onnxruntime). Pre-trained voice models for many languages, including Russian (ru_RU), are available [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=,Vietnamese%20%28vi_VN). The synthesis quality is high: the output sounds natural and intelligible, close to a human voice. According to feedback, Piper offers **fast generation** – nearly real-time even on a Raspberry Pi [REDDIT.COM](https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/comments/1c5pxhv/best_offline_texttospeech_tts_for_raspberry_pi_in/#:~:text=Hey%20everyone%21%20I%27ve%20scoured%20the,that%20you%20can%20test%20here), thanks to ONNX Runtime optimizations.

**Pros:**

- Excellent speech quality with natural-sounding output (VITS-based neural synthesis).
- Voices available for ~30 languages, including Russian [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=,Vietnamese%20%28vi_VN). The Russian voice is available free (with model license acceptance).
- **High performance on ARM:** Optimized for Raspberry Pi, works quickly even on CPU [REDDIT.COM](https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/comments/1c5pxhv/best_offline_texttospeech_tts_for_raspberry_pi_in/#:~:text=Hey%20everyone%21%20I%27ve%20scoured%20the,that%20you%20can%20test%20here). Supports streaming synthesis (outputs sound as it generates).
- Open source (MIT License) and an active community (Rhasspy/Open Home project).

**Cons:**

- Requires manual download of the voice model files (.onnx and .onnx.json) for the desired language [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=You%20will%20need%20two%20files,per%20voice). Model sizes are moderate (tens of MBs).
- Integration is slightly more complex than pure Python libraries: Piper is a C++ application with a CLI. There is no ready pip package for automatic model loading (at the time of review).
- Customization (e.g., training your own voices) requires a complex VITS training process.

**Installation (Ubuntu/Debian, ARM64):**

Piper can be installed in two ways – download a pre-built binary release or build from source. For OrangePi 5 Pro (ARM64), a pre-built release is recommended:

1. **Download:** From the Piper releases page, download the archive for `arm64` (64-bit ARM) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=You%20can%20run%20Piper%20with,or%20download%20a%20binary%20release) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=%2A%20amd64%20%20%2864,bit%20Raspberry%20Pi%203%2F4). Unpack it to a convenient location (e.g., `/opt/piper`).
2. **Install Dependencies (if building):** [HACKSTER.IO](https://www.hackster.io/sarakit/easy-offline-text-to-speech-on-raspberry-pi-a-tts-guide-255a0f#:~:text=follow%20these%20steps%20to%20install,Piper) Run:Then clone the Piper repository and run `make` (for building, you need to extract the piper_phonemize library as described in the README [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper#:~:text=%2A%20armv7%20%2832,3%2F4)).
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev libfmt-dev
    ```
    
3. **Voice Model:** Download the Russian model for Piper. Pre-trained voices are hosted on Hugging Face [HACKSTER.IO](https://www.hackster.io/sarakit/easy-offline-text-to-speech-on-raspberry-pi-a-tts-guide-255a0f#:~:text=Voices%20for%20Piper%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Frhasspy%2Fpiper). For Russian, for example, download the file `ru_RU...onnx` along with its corresponding `.onnx.json`. Save these in a directory, e.g., `~/piper_models/`.
4. **Testing:** Run the command:Piper will synthesize the given text and save the audio to `output.wav`. You can play the file or direct the output to your audio device.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Привет, мир!" | ./piper --model ~/piper_models/ru_RU-example.onnx --output_file output.wav
    
    ```
    

For Python integration, you can call Piper via the `subprocess` module (CLI) or use it as a linked C++ library (if built accordingly). Projects like Rhasspy/Home Assistant already support Piper directly.

## Coqui TTS

**Coqui TTS** is a powerful open-source toolkit for speech synthesis based on deep learning [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=match%20at%20L188%20Coqui%20TTS,voices%2C%20making%20it%20highly%20customizable). This library evolved from Mozilla TTS and allows you to use pre-trained models or train your own. Coqui TTS supports **many languages and voices**, including multi-speaker synthesis and voice cloning [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=Coqui%20TTS%20supports%20multiple%20languages%2C,term%20usability). For Russian, there are some pre-trained models available—for example, Coqui’s multilingual **XTTS** model supports 13 languages including Russian, enabling synthesis in Russian and even voice style transfer [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=Coqui%20TTS%20supports%20multiple%20languages%2C,term%20usability). Coqui also supports models like VITS/FastSpeech and others, which can be trained on Russian datasets (e.g., Mozilla Common Voice or M-AILABS for Russian).

**Pros:**

- **Flexibility and Customization:** Supports a variety of models (Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, FastSpeech, VITS, etc.) and vocoders (WaveRNN, HiFi-GAN, etc.) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=Spectrogram%20models) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=Vocoders). You can choose a model that meets your quality/speed requirements.
- **Multilingual and Voice Effects:** Allows synthesis in many languages, voice variation, pitch, and speed control; supports expressive elements (pauses, emphasis) and even voice cloning [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=,output.wav) [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=,DDC%22%2C%20progress_bar%3DFalse%29.to%28device).
- **Python API:** Install via `pip install TTS` [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=TTS%20is%20tested%20on%20Ubuntu,3.12). Usage is only a few lines (initialize the model by name and call `tts.tts_to_file(...)`). Directly integrable into scripts without external processes.
- **Community and Documentation:** Good repository examples and detailed documentation covering model parameters and usage.

**Cons:**

- **CPU Performance:** The models are resource-intensive. Most Coqui TTS models are designed to run with a GPU; on an OrangePi using a CPU [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=,time%20responsiveness), synthesis speed may be slow. For acceleration, you might need lighter models (e.g., FastSpeech) or export the model to ONNX/TensorRT.
- The CoquiAI project has reduced active support since 2024 [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=Coqui%20TTS%20supports%20multiple%20languages%2C,term%20usability). Although the source remains open, a lack of updates may limit new features or models.
- Pre-built Russian models may need to be found manually (e.g., on Hugging Face) or require training. Out-of-the-box, Coqui TTS does not provide a wide selection of Russian voices, complicating setup for inexperienced users.
- Dependency volume: Installation requires PyTorch, which on ARM may need to be compiled or require using onnxruntime as a backend.

**Installation (Ubuntu/Debian):**

1. **Python and Dependencies:** Ensure Python 3.9+ and pip are installed. Install PyTorch (e.g., via `pip install torch` or using conda)—for ARM64, you might need to use official PyTorch wheels or build from source.
2. **Install Coqui TTS:** [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=TTS%20is%20tested%20on%20Ubuntu,3.12) This installs the TTS package along with dependencies (numpy, scipy, PyTorch, etc.).
    
    ```bash
    pip install TTS
    ```
    
3. **Model Selection and Download:** Use the Python API to list available pre-trained models:If a suitable Russian model (e.g., `tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2`) is available, initialize it as:On first run, the package will download model weights from the internet. **Important:** Ensure network access to download the model (after which synthesis will be offline). If the model is unavailable, specify local paths for model configuration (.yaml) and weights (.pth).
    
    ```python
    from TTS.api import TTS
    print(TTS().list_models())
    ```
    
    ```python
    tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2")
    tts.tts_to_file(text="Привет, как дела?", file_path="output.wav", language="ru")
    ```
    
4. **Running Synthesis:** Once the model is downloaded, call `tts.tts()` for an array of sound samples or `tts.tts_to_file()` for direct WAV output. For example:
    
    ```python
    
    wav = tts.tts("Example offline synthesis.", speaker_wav=None, language="ru")
    ```
    
5. **Optimization (Optional):** To speed up synthesis on OrangePi, consider exporting the model to ONNX and using `onnxruntime` on ARM, or choose a smaller model. The Coqui TTS documentation contains details on ONNX export and usage [GITHUB.COM](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS#:~:text=Installation).

## Silero TTS

**Silero TTS** is a series of pre-trained neural speech synthesis models developed by the Russian team at Silero AI. The Silero models are designed for commercial use but are available for free; they are noted for their **compactness and efficiency**. Silero provides models for several languages, including **Russian (6 different voices)**, English, German, etc.. [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=,French%20%281%20speaker) The speech quality is very good – voices sound natural with proper intonation. A key feature of Silero TTS is that the models run efficiently on the CPU (without needing a GPU) [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=Silero%20Text,for%20several%20commonly%20spoken%20languages), providing **high speed** even on low-powered devices. Although a slight delay may be observed on very weak CPUs, on OrangePi the performance is typically sufficient [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=,performance%20on%20one%20CPU%20thread).

Silero models are based on an encoder-decoder architecture with a vocoder (e.g., HiFi-GAN). They support output at 16 kHz and 8 kHz, useful for various applications (telephony vs. multimedia). For Russian, both male and female voices are available with varying timbres.

**Pros:**

- **Ready-made high-quality Russian models:** 6 voices (male/female) [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=,French%20%281%20speaker) available. The synthesized speech sounds natural with proper intonation and clarity.
- **Small size and efficiency:** Models are compact (around 30–50 MB) and run quickly even on low-power CPUs [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=,performance%20on%20one%20CPU%20thread). They claim high throughput on slow hardware [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=,performance%20on%20one%20CPU%20thread) – fast processing even on weak devices. On OrangePi 5, synthesis of a phrase takes only fractions of a second or a few seconds.
- **Simple Integration:** Can be used via PyTorch Hub (load model with one line) [PYTORCH.ORG](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_tts/#:~:text=language%20%3D%20%27en%27%20speaker%20%3D,models) or by downloading the ONNX model and running it with onnxruntime. Minimal dependencies and easy function calls. Models are available on GitHub/Hub.
- **SSML Support:** Silero TTS supports SSML elements (modifying speed, pitch, etc.) [HABR.COM](https://habr.com/ru/articles/660565/#:~:text=%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8C%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%88%20%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B7%20%D0%B2,24%20%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%2048%20%D0%BA%D0%B8), allowing fine-tuning of the output.

**Cons:**

- **Licensing:** Silero models are free for testing and non-commercial use but require licensing for commercial deployment. For research and non-commercial projects, this is usually acceptable, but it must be noted.
- **Possible Artifacts:** Some users have reported slight background noise or a “metallic” timbre in the generated speech [HABR.COM](https://habr.com/ru/articles/595855/#:~:text=match%20at%20L208%20%D0%BF%D1%80,%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%40putnik%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8F). Also, synthesis of longer phrases [HABR.COM](https://habr.com/ru/articles/595855/#:~:text=match%20at%20L208%20%D0%BF%D1%80,%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%40putnik%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8F) may take a few seconds on CPU. (These observations are from around 2022; newer versions may have improved.)
- **Limited Expressiveness:** The functionality is primarily limited to synthesis – features like voice cloning or multi-speaker capabilities are not built-in. Additional functionalities might need to be implemented separately.

**Installation and Usage (Ubuntu/Debian):**

1. **Installation via PyPI:** Ensure Python 3.8+ and PyTorch are installed. You can use PyTorch Hub to load the model. For example:On first run, the chosen model is automatically downloaded from GitHub. The function `apply_tts` then synthesizes audio (a numpy array) which you can save.
    
    ```python
    
    import torch
    language = 'ru'
    speaker = 'baya'  # Example Russian voice name, e.g., 'baya' or 'eugene'
    device = torch.device('cpu')
    model, _, sample_rate, _, apply_tts = torch.hub.load(
        repo_or_dir='snakers4/silero-models',
        model='silero_tts',
        language=language,
        speaker=speaker
    )
    model.to(device)
    audio = apply_tts(text="Hello, I am speaking with Silero.", speaker=speaker)
    ```
    
2. **Alternative – ONNX:** If you prefer not to install PyTorch (which can be heavy), you can download the ONNX version of the model. In the Silero repository, `.onnx` files are available (see accompanying `.yml` files in the snakers4/silero-models repository). Once downloaded, install `onnxruntime` with:Then load the model:Using ONNX is slightly more complex, so PyTorch Hub is generally the simpler option.
    
    ```bash
    
    pip install onnxruntime
    ```
    
    ```python
    
    import onnxruntime as ort
    import numpy as np
    session = ort.InferenceSession("silero_model.onnx", providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
    # Prepare the input text (phonemization is required; see Silero documentation)
    ```
    
3. **Optional pip package:** A metapackage named `silero` exists on PyPI [PYPI.ORG](https://pypi.org/project/silero/#:~:text=silero%20,seriously%2C%20see%20benchmarks), though manual control is often preferred.
4. **Testing:** Once you have obtained the audio data (as a numpy array or torch.Tensor) via `apply_tts`, save it to a WAV file:Alternatively, you can use a library like `simpleaudio` to play the sound directly. On OrangePi 5 (ARM), you may need to configure ALSA/PulseAudio for audio output.
    
    ```python
    
    import soundfile as sf
    sf.write('output.wav', audio, sample_rate)
    ```
    

Silero TTS is an excellent choice for offline Russian speech synthesis if you need fast, efficient performance with good quality, especially on embedded systems like OrangePi.

## Mycroft Mimic3

**Mimic3** is a modern offline TTS engine developed by Mycroft AI, succeeding earlier versions (Mimic 1 based on Festival, Mimic 2 based on Tacotron). It is designed as an optimized neural solution for local usage [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=Mimic%203%20is%20Mycroft%E2%80%99s%20performance,cost%20devices). Mimic3 can generate very natural-sounding speech, comparable to top cloud TTS engines. It supports over 20 languages, including Russian [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=,Vietnamese), and offers many pre-trained voices (over 100, particularly for English). [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=,like%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi%204) [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20launching%20this%20preview%20of,voices%20available%20in%2025%20languages)

Its architecture is based on neural networks such as FastSpeech2/Glow-TTS with a neural vocoder (e.g., HiFi-GAN). The focus is on **performance**: Mimic3 is reported to run fully offline on low-cost devices like Raspberry Pi 4, achieving near real-time synthesis [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=speaking%20rate%20and%20volume%2C%20add,like%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi%204). This makes it attractive for deployment on OrangePi 5.

**Pros:**

- **High-quality synthesis:** Voices sound natural and human-like. Feedback often praises Mimic3 as one of the most natural offline TTS engines on Linux [REDDIT.COM](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ckspgl/mycrofts_mimic3_is_the_most_natural_sounding/#:~:text=I%20remember%20back%20in%20the,Linux%20I%27ve%20heard%20thus%20far).
- **Multilingual:** Supports a wide range of languages (at least 25 at release) – including Russian, English, French, Chinese, Ukrainian, etc.. [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=,Vietnamese) Multiple voice options are available for Russian (e.g., multi-speaker models with varied vocal characteristics).
- **Easy Installation and Integration:** Mimic3 is distributed as a Python package (`mycroft-mimic3-tts` available via pip). After installation, voices can be downloaded with a simple command and used via CLI or programmatically. The process is streamlined – no manual model search required.
- **Optimized for ARM:** Pre-built packages exist for ARM (including Debian packages for Raspberry Pi 3/4) [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=speaking%20rate%20and%20volume%2C%20add,like%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi%204) [COMMUNITY.OPENCONVERSATIONAL.AI](https://community.openconversational.ai/t/mimic-3-preview/12185#:~:text=Hey%20everyone%2C%20Mike%20from%20Mycroft,regarding%20Mimic%203%20Image%3A%20%3Aslight_smile). The code is written in C++ with optimized libraries, providing high speed without needing a GPU.
- **Additional Features:** Supports SSML, voice parameters (adjusting speed and pitch), and dynamic voice switching. Can run as a local TTS service triggered by commands.

**Cons:**

- **Model Size:** Some high-quality models can be large (hundreds of MBs), though lightweight versions with reduced quality are available (tens of MBs).
- **Limited Customization:** Training your own voices from scratch is challenging – Mimic3 relies on pre-trained voices. Mycroft provides tools for adding languages/voices if you have your own dataset.
- **Resource Usage:** Synthesis fully utilizes the CPU; on OrangePi 5, this is usually acceptable, but on weaker devices it may cause high load.
- **Young Project:** Being relatively new (released in 2022), some bugs or rough edges may remain, though the Mycroft community is actively developing it.

**Installation (Ubuntu/Debian):**

1. **Install the Package:**Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and an updated pip. This command installs the Mimic3 engine along with dependencies (including `onnxruntime` for fast execution).
    
    ```bash
    
    pip install mycroft-mimic3-tts
    ```
    
2. **Download Voices:** After installation, download at least one voice using the `mimic3-download` utility. For example, to download a multi-speaker Russian voice:(Available voices can be found in the Mimic3 documentation or repository; for example, `multi_low` is a low-size Russian multi-speaker model.)
    
    ```bash
    
    mimic3-download "ru_RU/multi_low"
    ```
    
3. **Test via CLI:**This command synthesizes the given text using the Russian voice and saves it to `output.wav`. Use `-stdout` to direct output to the audio stream.
    
    ```bash
    
    mimic3 --voice "ru_RU/multi_low" --text "Привет! This is a TTS test." --output output.wav
    
    ```
    
4. **Usage in Python:** You can call Mimic3 from your Python code using the subprocess module or its API. For example:After execution, `hello.wav` will contain the synthesized speech.
    
    ```python
    
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run([
        "mimic3", "--voice", "ru_RU/multi_low",
        "--text", "Hello, world!", "--output", "hello.wav"
    ])
    ```
    

Thus, Mimic3 provides an out-of-the-box, user-friendly, and fast method to achieve high-quality Russian offline TTS. It is well-suited for projects on OrangePi due to its ARM optimizations and straightforward setup.

## pyttsx3 (eSpeak NG)

**pyttsx3** is a Python library offering a cross-platform interface to system TTS engines. On Linux, it typically uses the **eSpeak NG** [STACKOVERFLOW.COM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48438686/realistic-text-to-speech-with-python-that-doesnt-require-internet#:~:text=The%20library%20supports%20the%20following,engines) engine—an open-source formant-based synthesizer that supports over 100 languages (including Russian). eSpeak is extremely lightweight and fast, making it ideal for simple tasks [NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40231630#:~:text=ESpeak,at%20high%20speeds%2C%20but). However, the synthesized voice sounds **mechanical** and lacks natural intonation—a trade-off for simplicity.

pyttsx3 allows developers to use eSpeak (or other engines like SAPI5 on Windows) via a unified API. Just a few lines of code enable text-to-speech completely offline [STACKOVERFLOW.COM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48438686/realistic-text-to-speech-with-python-that-doesnt-require-internet#:~:text=Using%20it%20should%20be%20as,simple%20as), making it well-suited for basic applications (e.g., system notifications or short text reads).

**Pros:**

- **Completely offline:** Does not require an internet connection; works “out-of-the-box” using the local eSpeak engine.
- **Lightweight and fast:** eSpeak is extremely low-resource, synthesizing speech almost instantly even on weak CPUs. On OrangePi 5, performance is more than sufficient.
- **Easy Integration:**Only a few lines are needed, and you can adjust the voice or speed via engine properties. [STACKOVERFLOW.COM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48438686/realistic-text-to-speech-with-python-that-doesnt-require-internet#:~:text=Using%20it%20should%20be%20as,simple%20as)
    
    ```python
    
    import pyttsx3
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say("Hello, how are you?")
    engine.runAndWait()
    ```
    
- **Cross-Platform:** The same code works on Linux, Windows, and macOS (using native engines). On Linux, eSpeak is widely available in most distributions.
- **Minimal Resource Usage:** Works even on boards with very limited memory and CPU.

**Cons:**

- **Lower Quality:** The synthesized voice is significantly lower in quality compared to neural TTS solutions. The output sounds outdated and robotic, making it unsuitable where natural-sounding speech is required [SMALLEST.AI](https://smallest.ai/blog/python-packages-realistic-text-to-speech#:~:text=A.%20Yes%2C%20some%20Python,based).
- **Limited Expressiveness:** There is little scope to modify timbre or achieve more lively speech—eSpeak produces a fixed, synthetic voice. Although Russian pronunciation is intelligible, it may sound accented or less natural.
- **Limited Prosody Support:** While you can pass pause or emphasis tags to eSpeak, they offer limited natural variation.
- eSpeak has not advanced significantly in terms of quality, remaining suitable only for very basic use cases.

**Installation (Ubuntu/Debian):**

1. **Install eSpeak NG:** It is usually pre-installed; if not, run:Optionally, install the Python bindings with:However, pyttsx3 typically uses the available system engine automatically.
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo apt install espeak-ng
    ```
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo apt install python3-espeakng
    ```
    
2. **Install pyttsx3:**Ensure that `libespeak-ng` is installed (usually handled by the package manager).
    
    ```bash
    
    pip install pyttsx3
    ```
    
3. **Example Code:**Usually, eSpeak auto-detects the language from the text, but you can explicitly set it if needed.
    
    ```python
    
    import pyttsx3
    engine = pyttsx3.init()  # Initialize the engine
    # Optionally switch to a Russian voice if not automatically selected
    for voice in engine.getProperty('voices'):
        if voice.name.lower().startswith('russian') or voice.id.startswith('ru'):
            engine.setProperty('voice', voice.id)
            break
    engine.say("Hello, this is a test.")
    engine.runAndWait()
    ```
    
4. **Adjustments:** Change the rate with `engine.setProperty('rate', 150)` (default is ~200 wpm). You may also adjust pitch and volume, though the synthetic quality remains.
5. **Running:** When `engine.runAndWait()` is called, eSpeak synthesizes and plays the speech via the system’s audio output. On headless OrangePi setups, ensure ALSA is configured (test with `espeak-ng "test"` in the terminal).

In summary, **pyttsx3 + eSpeak** is an excellent choice for minimalist tasks where offline operation and simplicity are paramount, though the synthesized voice quality is noticeably synthetic. For higher-quality Russian TTS, neural solutions like Piper, Silero, or Mimic3 are recommended.
