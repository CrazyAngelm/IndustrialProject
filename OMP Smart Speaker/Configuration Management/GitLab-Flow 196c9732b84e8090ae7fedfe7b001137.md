# GitLab-Flow

This document defines the Git workflow for our project repository, ensuring a structured and efficient development process with **environment branches**. This approach maintains a stable codebase while enabling iterative development and seamless deployments.

## What is GitLab-Flow?

GitLab-Flow strikes a balance between Git-Flow and GitHub-Flow. It adopts GitHub-Flow’s simplicity while introducing additional branches representing staging environments before production. The main branch still represents the production environment.

## Branching Strategy

We follow **GitLab Flow with environment branches**, ensuring that code progresses through multiple testing and deployment stages.

- **Main Branches**:
    - `main`: Serves as the integration branch where all feature branches are merged and tested before moving to staging.
    - `staging`: Represents the pre-production environment where final testing occurs before deployment (additional).
    - `production`: Represents the live system running in production.
- **Supporting Branches**:
    - **Issue Resolving Branches**: (`<#issue>-<short-description>`): Used for developing new features, created from `main`.
    - **Bugfix Branches** (`bugfix/<short-description>`): Used for fixing bugs found in `main` or `staging`.
    - **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/<short-description>`): Created from `production` for urgent fixes.

## **Branch Rules**:

- Feature branches are merged into `main` via Merge Requests (MRs).
- Once stable, `main` is merged into `staging` for pre-production testing.
- After approval, `staging` is merged into `production`.
- Hotfixes are merged directly into `production` and backported to `main`.

## Commit Conventions:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Miscellaneous changes (e.g., updating dependencies)
- `config`: Adding or changing configuration
