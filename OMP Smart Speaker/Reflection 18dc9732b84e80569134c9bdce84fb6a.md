# Retrospective session - 1.03

|  | Positives | Negatives | Suggested Improvements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| @Максим Кожинов  | 1. We provided demo of working prototype to customer relatively soon | 1. Transition to toggl seems to be an overkill of time tracking by university, as we can create necessary time tracking charts through GitLab API. |  |
| @real pxkn  |  |  |  |
| @Альберт Аксёнов  |  |  |  |
| @Самат Гатин  | 1. Development processes have stabilized.
2. Overall Team communication improved after we add mid-sprint sync meeting. | 1. I had to frequently remind other team members to complete their tasks, as the status of my tasks depended on the results of their work. | 1. Start interrelated tasks with joint planning. |

| @real pxkn  |  |  |  |
