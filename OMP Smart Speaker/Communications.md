# Communications

Effective communication in a project ensures alignment and smooth collaboration:

- **With the Team:** Regular meetings, clear task distribution, and open discussions to track progress and resolve issues.
- **With the Mentor:** Guidance sessions for strategic advice, problem-solving, and learning from experience.
- **With the Customer:** Structured updates, feedback collection, and expectation management to ensure satisfaction.

Strong communication minimizes misunderstandings and keeps the project on track.
