# OMP: Smart Speaker

Our project aims to develop a **Smart Speaker** that operates primarily in a closed (offline) environment without continuous Internet access. This is a proof of concept (PoC) to validate the feasibility of providing voice assistant functionality â€” such as speech recognition (STT), speech synthesis (TTS), and basic command processing â€” entirely within a userâ€™s local network or infrastructure.
